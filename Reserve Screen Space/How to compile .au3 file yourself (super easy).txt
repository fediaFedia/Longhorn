Alright so maybe you don't want to run some random *.exe file you downloaded from the internet.

Good for you for being vigilant, there's viruses out there.
So here's how to compile it yourself from the source code:

Download AutoIT: 

https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/

Install it (The irony, I know)
Open the SelectAppIco.au3 file with it and select in the Menubar: Tools > GO

The exe file should be in the folder now.
That's it!
