Omnimo App was originally built for Omnimo as it includes some neat tools and helper utilities.
I didn't re-compile it for Longhorn because trigger happy antiviruses like to delete anything they haven't seen before.
As this App has been around for years it is now mostly "trusted" so it doesn't get nuked.

Here's the source code if you're concerned: https://github.com/fediaFedia/Omnimo/blob/master/AutoIT/OmnimoApp.au3
